Currently, for officially supported models listed in the <a href="https://github.com/rebellions-sw/rbln-model-zoo" class="underline" target="_blank">RBLN Model Zoo</a>, you can use the provided compilation and inference example code.

If youâ€™re using a modified model or a model not included in the Model Zoo, technical support may be limited, and compilation may fail.
First, check the <a href="https://docs.rbln.ai/en/misc/error_code.html" class="underline" target="_blank">error code</a> to identify the cause. If further assistance is required, please reach out via the <a href="discuss.rebellions.ai" class="underline" target="_blank">Rebellions Dev Forum</a>.
