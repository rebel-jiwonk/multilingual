The RBLN Driver can be installed using the provided `deb` or `rpm` installation files and requires root privileges. During installation, you must ensure that the kernel version is compatible with the driver.

In most cases, we provide an environment with the Driver pre-installed. If installation is required, please refer to the <a href="https://docs.rbln.ai/en/getting_started/installation_guide.html?h=driver#installation" class="underline" target="_blank">Installation Guide</a>.
