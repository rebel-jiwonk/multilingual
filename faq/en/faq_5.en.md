Currently, RBLN SDK only supports Linux. Windows support will be determined based on our technical roadmap.

More details on the supported OS and Python version can be found on the <a href="https://docs.rbln.ai/supports/version_matrix.html" class="underline" target="_blank">Support Matrix</a> page.
