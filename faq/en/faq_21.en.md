While both NPUs (Neural Processing Units) and GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) perform parallel computations, they differ in their optimized computation methods and intended use cases.

GPUs were originally designed for graphics rendering but have been widely adopted for AI training and high-performance computing (HPC) due to their large-scale parallel processing capabilities. They typically use FP32/FP16 operations and support various types of computation through CUDA cores and Tensor Cores.

NPUs are processors specialized for AI and deep learning, designed to perform efficient computations at low power. They are optimized for low-bit operations such as INT8 and FP16 and include dedicated hardware architectures that accelerate neural network computations.
