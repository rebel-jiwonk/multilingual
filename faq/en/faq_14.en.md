To process video files, you can use libraries like OpenCV (cv2) to extract each frame from an `.mp4` file as an image, and then feed those frames into the model for inference.

For example, when using an object detection model like YOLOX, the typical procedure is as follows:

1.Load the video file using cv2.VideoCapture
2.Extract frames one by one
3.Preprocess each frame to match the modelâ€™s input format
4.Perform object detection using the model
5.Visualize the results and either save them or display them in real time
