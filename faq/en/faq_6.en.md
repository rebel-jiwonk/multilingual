Python 3.9 or higher is recommended, and there are key package dependencies such as numpy, torch, and onnx.

Please refer to the <a href="https://docs.rbln.ai/supports/version_matrix.html" class="underline" target="_blank">Support Matrix</a> page for the supported OS and Python versions.
Required packages may vary by model, so refer to the `requirements.txt` file included in the <a href="https://github.com/rebellions-sw/rbln-model-zoo" class="underline" target="_blank">Model Zoo code</a> for details.
